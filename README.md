# My cheat sheets

In this repo I will be adding commands cheat sheets that I think they will be useful for me (and others) during my studies and, hopefully, when I start working.


## Description

The cheat sheets are written in Markdown and can be found at [valsells.me/mycheatsheets](https://valsells.me/mycheatsheets/) with the help of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Contributions and suggestions are welcome via PR and project issues. CONTRIBUTING.md for details to be done.
